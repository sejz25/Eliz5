The Explain Like I’m Five (ELI5) Tool takes complicated science, legal, or technical text and rewrites it in a way a 5-year-old could understand — simple, friendly, and crystal clear.
🚀 What This Tool Does
Paste in something complex like this:
“Photosynthesis is the biochemical process by which autotrophic organisms convert light energy into chemical energy.”
And get something like this:
“Plants use sunlight like food. The sunlight helps them make their own snacks so they can grow big and strong.”
Boom. 🌱
Same meaning. Way easier to understand.
